**Sonic Sculpting**
   Michael Mara
Core idea:

Sonic "glass blowing"; create sculptures by making objects with your voice. Press a button to begin, and then a tube-like object is emitted from your virtual mouth, with its width controlled by (smoothed) volume

You then can create more (non-radially symmetric) sculptures by moving the camera around and making multiple versions.



Extras:
+ Change visual characteristics via other properties of sound
+ Moving existing sculptures via voice
+ Painting with sound (pitch controls color)
+ Have UI controlled solely via sound (though K.I.S.S.)

Notes:
This is basically a whimsical version of VRClay (http://vrclay.com/) using audio. As such, I would like to make it a VR application. This would actually *save* development time given my current setup, but I would be unable to run the program on a small demo laptop, and certainly not have a representative experience simultaneous experienced by a large group, and so would nix the VR component unless you think thats ok.
